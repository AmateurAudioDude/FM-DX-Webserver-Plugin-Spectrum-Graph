# Spectrum Graph plugin for FM-DX Webserver

This plugin scans the FM radio band in under 1.5 seconds, then displayed in a spectrum window.

## Instructions

* [Download the latest zip file](https://github.com/AmateurAudioDude/FM-DX-Webserver-Plugin-Spectrum-Graph/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Transfer `SpectrumGraph` folder, and `SpectrumGraph.js` to FM-DX Webserver `plugins` folder
* Restart FM-DX Webserver if required
* Login to Adminstrator Panel and enable plugin
* Restart FM-DX Webserver again if required
* Server-side configuration options stored in `/plugins_configs/SpectrumGraph.json`
* Client-side configuration options located in `SpectrumGraph.js`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For full compatibility, **TEF668X radio** requires **TEF6686_ESP32 v2.11.11 beta** or newer firmware, available from the FMDX.org Discord server, or alternatively, download my latest fork [here](https://github.com/AmateurAudioDude/TEF6686_ESP32).

## SpectrumGraph.json
 
- **`rescanDelay`**: Number of seconds elapsed since the previous scan before a new scan can be initiated.   
- **`tuningRange`**: Side frequencies to scan, in MHz. A value of 0 scans the entire FM/OIRT band.   
- **`tuningStepSize`**: Tuning step size, in kHz. Recommended values are either 100 or 50.   
- **`tuningBandwidth`**: Supported bandwidth values are 0, 56, 64, 72, 84, 97, 114, 133, 151, 168, 184, 200, 217, 236, 254, 287, and 311.   

> [!TIP]
> The granular control by **`tuningStepSize`** allows the graph's step size to be adjusted from 100 kHz to 50 kHz, enabling more precise RF signal analysis. This will, however, increase the time it takes to perform a scan.
